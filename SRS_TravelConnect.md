1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
This SRS describes the functional and non-functional requirements for Travel Connect — a web application that enables travelers to search, plan and book travel services (flights, stays, experiences, events, and travel essentials) and enables travel vendors to list and manage their services. It covers authentication, onboarding flows, role-based onboarding (traveler, travel vendor, admin), vendor category flows, AI-powered itinerary planning, booking, payments, and administrative functions.

1.2 Scope
The system provides:
- Public-facing landing and discovery pages.
- AI-powered trip planner that generates itineraries based on user input.
- User authentication and onboarding flows, including role selection, interests, and preferences.
- Vendor onboarding and vendor category-driven flows (airlines, stays, experiences, events, products, other services).
- Property-owner style onboarding for listing stays (moved under vendor/stays flow).
- Admin dashboard for platform management.
- Booking, payment, wallet, rewards, and vendor payout integration.
- Integration points for third-party services: OAuth providers, payment processors (Stripe), transactional email/SMS, and hosting/DB providers (Neon, Supabase, Netlify).

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- AI: Artificial Intelligence
- SRS: Software Requirements Specification
- MVP: Minimum Viable Product
- DB: Database
- OAuth: Open Authorization
- API: Application Programming Interface

2. Overall Description

2.1 Product Perspective
Travel Connect is a web application built with React + TypeScript. It uses modular components (UI library) and client-side routing. The app will be backed by a serverless or hosted backend (Postgres via Neon or Supabase), with optional ORMs (Prisma) and server functions for secure operations.

2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
- Traveler: Searches, plans, books, manages wallet and payments, saves preferences.
- Travel Vendor: Registers to list services in categories (Airlines, Stays, Experiences, Events, Products & Essentials, Other Services). Vendors set pricing, media, availability and manage bookings.
- Admin: Platform operations, user & vendor management, content moderation, integrations.

2.3 Operating Environment
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) - desktop and mobile responsive design.
- Backend: Node.js serverless functions or dedicated Node server, Postgres DB, OAuth provider configs.
- Hosting: Netlify / Vercel / Fly / Cloud provider.

2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Must comply with GDPR/CCPA for user data handling.
- Passwords hashed using strong algorithms (bcrypt/argon2).
- Use secure storage for secrets (env variables, MCP integrations via Builder.io platform popover).

3. Functional Requirements

3.1 Authentication and Authorization
3.1.1 Sign Up (Manual)
- Fields: username (required), email (required), phone (optional), password, confirm password, accept terms.
- Client validates password strength and matching confirm password.
- On success, user redirected to onboarding (/onboarding).
- Server-side: create user record, enforce unique username/email/phone, hash password, send email/phone verification token.

3.1.2 Social Login
- OAuth: Google, Facebook, LinkedIn.
- Map provider profile to user record; prompt to choose username if needed.

3.1.3 Sign In
- Accepts email or phone and password.
- Return helpful errors: account not found, invalid password.
- Supports password reset flow via email or phone.

3.2 Onboarding
3.2.1 Role Selection
- Roles: Traveler (default), Travel Vendor, Admin (invite-only or controlled).
- If Travel Vendor selected, redirect to vendor categories page (/vendors).
- If Admin selected, redirect to admin dashboard (/admin).

3.2.2 Traveler Onboarding Steps
- Profile completion (display name, avatar).
- Interests/themes selection (min 3 recommended).
- Destinations selection (min 1 required).
- Traveler type selection (solo, family, business, etc.).
- Payment/wallet setup and rewards opt-in (optional).
- On complete, navigate to AI Planner or dashboard.

3.2.3 Travel Vendor Onboarding
- Vendors pick a category (airlines, stays, experiences, events, products, other).
- Category-specific onboarding:
  - Stays: property details, media upload, amenities, pricing, calendar sync → uses the existing property onboarding flow.
  - Airlines: inventory connection/onboarding (carrier integration specifics would be added later).
  - Experiences/Events: scheduling, ticketing, capacity.
  - Products & Essentials: catalog, SKU, shipping rules.
- Vendor verification (identity/business docs), payout setup (Stripe Connect recommended), and review/publish process.

3.3 AI Planner
- Input: free-text description of trip, dates, travelers, preferences.
- Output: itinerary (day-by-day), booking suggestions, estimated costs.
- Users can adjust preferences and re-generate itinerary.
- Saved itineraries and share/export options (PDF/Download).

3.4 Discovery and Search
- Service categories: stays, flights, experiences, events, essentials.
- Filters: dates, location, price, amenities, ratings, vendor.
- Sorting: relevance, price, rating, popularity.

3.5 Booking and Payments
- Booking flow: select service → review → payment → confirmation + e-ticket/receipt.
- Payment methods: card tokenization (Stripe), wallet balance, third-party wallets.
- Refund and cancellation policies per vendor.

4.2 Performance
- Page load times should be under 3s on average mobile networks for primary pages.
- Backend should handle 100 requests/sec at MVP scale; scale horizontally behind load balancer.

4.3 Scalability
- Stateless application servers with horizontal scaling.
- Use managed Postgres (Neon or Supabase) and caching (Redis) for frequent read paths.

4.4 Availability
- Target 99.9% uptime for critical services (auth, booking payment flows).

4.5 Compliance & Privacy
- GDPR/CCPA compliance: data deletion, consent recording, data portability.
- Store consent records with timestamps and versions of policy accepted.

5. Data Model (High-Level)

8. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (selected)
- As a new user, I can sign up with a unique username and email, receive verification, and complete onboarding → account created and redirected to AI Planner.
- As a traveler, I can describe my trip and receive a generated itinerary with actionable booking options.
